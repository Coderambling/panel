# Display Performance with Indicators

Welcome to our tutorial on  Panel's [indicators](https://panel.holoviz.org/reference/index.html#indicators)! I suggested this change because the tutorial is about indicators, with the windturbines app as an example. As it is, it suggests a little that it is more the other way around.

We will delve into it with an example that uses indicators to visualizes the key metrics of wind turbines in an engaging and insightful manner. The result will be this:

Put the Winturbine app here, and / or (fallback to) an (animated) gif. So user has a visual straight away of what the tutorial will produce. Put it in a collapsible section.

## Explore Indicators

Panel provides a rich collection of indicators to suit your needs. (There are 10 indicators available, and vast means a very large amount).

In this tutorial, we'll explore various indicators offered by Panel to showcase the performance metrics:

- **Current Performance**: Utilize the [`Number`](../../reference/indicators/Number.ipynb) indicator to display the current performance.
- **Trending Performance**: Employ the [`Trend`](../../reference/indicators/Trend.ipynb) indicator to showcase the trending performance over time.

For a comprehensive list of indicators and their detailed reference guides, refer to the [Indicators Section](https://panel.holoviz.org/reference/index.html#indicators) in the [Component Gallery](../../reference/index.md).

Show, don't tell: put the gallery of 2 x 5 components straight below the link as html, as it is shown in the component gallery page above. Maybe smaller, and in a collapsible section (that is uncollapsed be default).

Much more visual impact and shows the user straight away what the possibilities are. Maybe shrink the 2 x 5 gallery down a little.


:::{note}
Throughout this tutorial, whenever we refer to "run the code," you can execute it directly in the Panel docs using the green *run* button, in a notebook cell, or within a file named `app.py` served with `panel serve app.py --autoreload`.

## Display a Number

Let's start by displaying the wind speed using the `Number` indicator:

```{pyodide}
import panel as pn

pn.extension()

pn.indicators.Number(
    name="Wind Speed",
    value=8.6,
    format="{value} m/s",
    colors=[(10, "green"), (100, "red")],
).servable()
```

:::{note}
Adding `.servable()` to the `Number` indicator incorporates it into the app served by `panel serve app.py --autoreload`. Note that it's not necessary for displaying the indicator in a notebook.
:::

Feel free to tweak the `value` from `8.6` to `11.4` and observe the color change to *red*.

## Display a Trend

Next, let's visualize the hourly average wind speed trend:

```{pyodide}
import panel as pn
import numpy as np

pn.extension()

def get_wind_speeds(n):
    # Replace this with your own wind speed data source
    return {"x": np.arange(n), "y": 8 + np.random.randn(n)}

pn.indicators.Trend(
    name="Wind Speed (m/s, hourly avg.)",
    data=get_wind_speeds(24),
    width=500,
    height=300,
).servable()
```

Experiment by adjusting the `height` parameter from `300` to `500`.

For more detailed insights into the `Trend` indicator, take a moment to explore its [reference guide](../../reference/indicators/Trend.ipynb). Trust us, it's worth it!

## Explore the Indicators
I would put this section at the very top of the document.

Panel provides a rich collection of indicators to suit your needs. (There are 10 indicators available, and vast means a very large amount).

Click [this link](https://panel.holoviz.org/reference/index.html#indicators) to explore the available indicators and their detailed reference guides.

Show, don't tell: start with a strong visual impact and show the user straight away what the Tutorial is about Do this by keeping the link, and putting the gallery of 2 x 5 components straight below the link, like it is presented in the component gallery link above. Maybe smaller, and put it in a collapsible section. 



## Recap

In this tutorial, we've embarked on visualizing the performance metrics of wind turbines using Panel's versatile indicators:

- Leveraged the [`Number`](../../reference/indicators/Number.ipynb) indicator to display current performance.
- Utilized the [`Trend`](../../reference/indicators/Trend.ipynb) indicator to showcase trending performance over time.

Remember, there's a plethora of indicators waiting for you to explore in the [Indicators Section](https://panel.holoviz.org/reference/index.html#indicators) of the [Component Gallery](../../reference/index.md). Keep experimenting and uncovering new insights! ðŸš€
